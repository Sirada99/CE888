The respiratory for lab 10 is here: https://github.com/Sirada99/sample
I try my best to modify and deploy it (created three models from Heart Disease UCI data and change the Application code).
When I'm trying to deploy, it gave error that there are something wrong in the application so I check the logs to find out the error.
However, I don't understand the error so I cannot fix it. I'm sure that I did the same as the lecturer tell us to do.
